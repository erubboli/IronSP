  body: Process the template and return the result. The first time this method is
  called, the template source is evaluated with instance_eval. On the sequential method
  calls it will compile the template to an unbound method which will lead to better
  performance. In any case, template executation is guaranteed to be performed in
  the scope object with the locals specified and with support for yielding to the
  block.
